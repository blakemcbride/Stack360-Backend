Evolution Export
(last updated 6/10/14)

The export produces two different CSV files sent in two different ways
as follows:

CSV files:
	Demographics
	Deductions

Two exports:

	Employee Payroll - nothing done with the files

	Evolution Export - files sent over HTTPS
	Arahant wrote the receiving end too
	The receiving end is currently lost but I may be able to find it.
	It should be a relatively simple servlet though.

	
The export appears to export (fixed) salary information but not
timeclock information.
