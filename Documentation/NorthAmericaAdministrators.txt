Documentation for North America Administrators benefits

1.  There should be a single vendor defined as interface = North America 
    Administrators

2.  The Group Identifier in the interface is taken from the Account field of
    the Vendor

3.  Multiple benefits can be associated to that one vendor.  The type of the 
    benefit is determined by the Internal ID field for each benefit.  The 
    expected ID's (which is not case sensitive) is:

    a. Medical
    b. Dental
    c. Vision
    d. Rxd
    e. Flex Medical
    f. Flex Dependent

    At least one must be defined.  There should be no duplicates.
    Naturally, there should be appropriate benefit configs setup for each 
    benefit.

4.  The Participant ID (Family ID) is a problem because multiple benefits are
    represented by a single line.  This ID must be associated to the employee
    benefit and not the employee in order to support multiple providers.  So
    the Participant ID is taken from the employee's benefit association in the
    field labeled Insurance ID.  I look for the first applicable benefit with an
    existing ID and I use that.  So, at least one of the applicable benefits
    must have a valid Insurance ID.  If multiple are defined they must be and
    are assumed to be the same.

5.  Medical Plan is taken from the Benefit's Plan

6.  Medical Enrollment is taken from the Benefit Config's Additional Information

7.  PPO Network is taken form the Medical benefit's Plan Name

8.  In terms of 5 & 6, the same is true for dental, vision, etc.

9.  Flex Medical and Flex Dependent types will be incorrectly reported because
    we don't have the relevant information (pay schedules, deduction dates,
    first deduction date, etc.)
